# Bayesian Inference Course Repository

This repository contains assignments, quizzes, and exams for my **Bayesian Inference** course.

## About Bayesian Inference  
Bayesian Inference is a method of statistical inference that applies Bayes’ Theorem to update the probability for a hypothesis as more evidence or data becomes available. This course covers the principles of Bayesian methods and their applications in various fields, including data science and machine learning. Key topics in this course include:
- **Bayes’ Theorem**: Fundamental concepts of prior, likelihood, and posterior distributions.
- **Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)**: Techniques for sampling from complex probability distributions.
- **Bayesian Models**: Hierarchical models, conjugate priors, and model comparison.
- **Posterior Distributions**: Estimation and decision-making based on posterior distributions.

## Repository Contents  
- **Assignments**: Exercises on Bayesian methods, model building, and posterior analysis.
- **Quizzes**: Tests of theoretical understanding and computational techniques.
- **Exams**: Comprehensive assessments of Bayesian inference concepts and applications.

This repository reflects my learning journey in mastering Bayesian statistical methods.
